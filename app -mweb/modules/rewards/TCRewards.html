                </span>A Member is eligible to receive credit ("Rewards") on the Member's account for qualifying purchases made by the Member ("Qualifying Purchases"), as defined below, that are made at Staples stores in the U.S., by phone at 1-800-333-3330 or online at staples.com<span class="s3"><sup>®</sup></span> and for which a Membership account is identified. All Qualifying Purchases are subject to verification by Staples before being credited to a Member's account. Unless otherwise specified, throughout these Terms, the phrase "Qualifying Purchase" and "Qualifying Purchase Amount" mean the amount paid at checkout after application of all promotions, coupons, instant savings, and Rewards redemption. Product specific coupons are applied pro rata (proportionately allocated across all items purchased in a given transaction) for the purposes of calculating Qualifying Purchase Amount(s) for Rewards.
                <br>
                <b>The following Purchases are ineligible toward earning Rewards:</b>
                <br>

                <br>
                Qualifying Purchases made by the Member but for which the Member's account number was not used at the time of the transaction can be added to the Member account if Staples is contacted with the original 17-digit receipt barcode number from the store receipt or order number, and the Member's account number, at staples.com or by calling 1-800-793-3320 as promptly as possible after the date of the transaction, but within the current quarter or the two previous calendar quarters only. Only purchases made by the Member may be added to the Member's account. Purchases are credited upon verification within five days after they are requested. Qualifying Purchases that have been verified are applied to the Member's account with a transaction date of the date approved. A maximum of 10 purchases may be requested to be credited per day. Qualifying Purchases cannot be transferred, sold or bartered.
